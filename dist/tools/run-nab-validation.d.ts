/** SLICE 6 — anomaly-likelihood smoothing (NAB-aware window logic).
 *
 *  Replaces the raw cooldown wrapper with a Numenta-style persistence
 *  filter: a fire is emitted only when at least `thresholdCount` of the
 *  most recent `windowK` ticks have detector-fire=true. After emit,
 *  fires are suppressed for `cooldownTicks` (anomaly-likelihood
 *  effectively forms a "confirmed alert" once the rolling count crosses
 *  threshold).
 *
 *  Motivation: page-CUSUM crosses threshold at the FIRST tick of a
 *  sustained shift, but NAB labeled windows trail the actual change
 *  point by ~200–1500 ticks. Empirical classification of the SLICE 5
 *  output showed ~30% of labeled windows have detector fires within
 *  ±500 ticks of the window edge but OUTSIDE the credit zone. Requiring
 *  the rolling fire-count to cross a threshold (a) delays emit until
 *  the anomaly is sustained, increasing the chance the emit lands
 *  inside the labeled window, and (b) dedupes noisy spurious fires
 *  (single-tick CUSUM spikes that don't repeat) so they don't burn
 *  cooldown windows on isolated FPs.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *  - `windowK`: rolling-window length over which fire-count is summed.
 *  - `thresholdCount`: minimum count of fire=true ticks in the window
 *    required to emit. With windowK=50, thresholdCount=25 means
 *    "detector must have fired in ≥ 50% of the last 50 ticks".
 *  - `cooldownTicks`: post-emit suppression length.
 *
 *  Anti-scope: pure dispatch-layer wrapper; no engine state coupling. */
